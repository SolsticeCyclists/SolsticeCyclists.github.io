	<title>Solstice Cyclists Parade Rules</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>The Rules of the Ride</h2>
<strong>Be respectful of your fellow cyclists.</strong> We&#8217;re a big group on narrow streets and accidents do happen! Don&#8217;t weave or do tricks unless you&#8217;re well away from other cyclists. Keep to the right side of the street to allow others to loop back.<strong>Be respectful of parade spectators.</strong> The Fremont Solstice Parade is a family friendly event. Folks expect the painted cyclists, but they may not want your junk in their kid&#8217;s face. Use good judgment when interacting with spectators.</p>
<p><strong>Be respectful of other parade participants.</strong> Don&#8217;t ever ride among the ensembles.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t be impaired.</strong> There&#8217;s some tricky riding involved; alcohol and other drugs really don&#8217;t mix with this.</p>
