<h3>Paint party rules</h3>
Here are some rules designed to make the main paint party safe and comfortable for all of us, and meet the needs of our generous hosts at CSR Marine.
<ul>
<li>The paint party is only for cyclists, painters, and a few registered photographers.  To get in the front gate you need
<ul>
<li>wheels (identifying you as a rider), or</li>
<li>painting equipment (if you&#8217;re just painting others), or</li>
<li>a photographer badge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We will ask for a donation of $10 toward the cost of hosting the paint party, but if you can&#8217;t afford that, you won&#8217;t be turned away. Any extra money will be donated to a related non-profit.</li>
<li>No alcohol or other drugs are allowed on site.</li>
<li>Please only smoke in the designated area (see the map).</li>
<li>Do not touch any of the boats; don&#8217;t let paint splatter on any boats!!!</li>
<li>No glitter except in the one designated spot.</li>
<li>Please arrive with plenty of time to get painted, and exit the building promptly when asked. Our volunteers need time to close up and join the ride.</li>
<li>Kids under 18 are allowed, but they should not be nude.</li>
<li>Please clean up your area:
<ul>
<li>Wipe up any spilled paint.</li>
<li>Throw away disposables.</li>
<li>Bring any extra paint to the sharing table for others to use (if it&#8217;s acrylic).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t leave anything behind at the paint site.</li>
</ul>
If you&#8217;re using the shared paint, here are some additional guidelines.
<ul>
<li>For each color you need:
<ul>
<li>Take a small amount of paint in a cup (or bring the whole container if it&#8217;s small); try to find an existing cup before pouring a new one.</li>
<li>Feel free to mix colors if you don&#8217;t find the hue you want; you can also thin the paint with water.</li>
<li>Move away from the paint table to apply it.</li>
<li>Return your cup to the table sorted with others of the same color.</li>
<li>Leave the paint brush in the cup; get a new brush for each new color.</li>
<li>Repeat till done!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There will be a broad selection of colors available at the start, but towards the end, colors may run out. If you must have a specific color, bring your own, or come early.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Additional rules for anyone with a camera</strong></h3>
<p style="display: inline !important;">These guidelines apply even if you’re only taking a few pictures of your friends.  People who have trouble following them will be asked to leave.</p>
<ul>
<li>If photography is your primary reason for showing up, you need to apply for one of the few photographer slots.</li>
<li>Identify yourself and ask permission of everybody you capture in your pictures.
<ul>
<li>This includes anybody identifiable in the shot, not just your primary target.</li>
<li>If you will be making the pictures publicly available, make that clear.</li>
<li><strong>Be especially careful about capturing unpainted or partially painted people!</strong></li>
<li>Don&#8217;t take video; there’s always somebody in the background.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t be a creep.  (If you have to ask, you may be at risk.)</li>
<li>When polite discussion breaks down, ties go to the person who isn&#8217;t holding a camera.</li>
</ul>
For the rest of us, a warning: the painting meet-up is not a public space, but there is still no guarantee of privacy.  We try, but if being seen naked on the Internet will ruin your life, stay home.
